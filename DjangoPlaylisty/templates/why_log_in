      To be able to generate Spotify playlists using our web app, we kindly
      ask you to log in with your Spotify account. This is a necessary step to
      provide you with a seamless and personalized experience. We understand
      that you may have concerns about privacy and the security of your
      information, so we want to assure you that your data is safe.

      When you log in with your Spotify account, our web app uses Spotify's
      Application Programming Interface (API) to securely authenticate your
      account. The API allows us to access limited information about your
      Spotify profile, such as your display name and public playlists, which
      we use solely for the purpose of generating personalized playlists for
      you.

      It's important to note that we do not store or have access to your
      Spotify account credentials, such as your username or password. The
      authentication process is handled entirely by Spotify, ensuring that
      your sensitive information remains confidential. We prioritize your
      privacy and adhere to all necessary security measures to protect your
      data.

      By logging in with your Spotify account, you enable our web app to
      leverage the vast music library and features offered by Spotify. This
      allows us to curate playlists tailored to your musical preferences,
      considering your listening history, favorite artists, and genre
      preferences. The result is a personalized playlist experience that
      caters to your unique taste in music.

      We value your trust and understand the importance of transparency when
